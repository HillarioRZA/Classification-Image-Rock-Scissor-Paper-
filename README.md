Rock, Paper, Scissors Image Classification
This project is an image classification model for the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. It was developed as part of my learning journey in machine learning. The model classifies images into three categories: rock, paper, or scissors.

Key features of the project:

Uses a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.
Trained on a dataset of labeled images of rock, paper, and scissors.
Aimed at beginners who are learning the basics of machine learning and deep learning.
Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and use it as a starting point for your own projects!
